# Atari 400/800 4x16k cartridge and case

## Bill of materials

- One 74LS00 in DIP package
- Two 10K resistors
- One 100n capacitor
- Two DIP switches (to switch between 16K ROM blocks). You can use solder jumpers instead if you want.
- One 28-pin DIP socket (optional)
- 27C256 or 27C512 ROM chip

## Case
There are 3 versions of 
- Solid shell
- WIth a cut-out for DIP switches
- WIth a cut-out for DIP switches and EEPROM chip

## Notes
- If you use a case without a cut-out, you most solder in the EEPROM chip, it will not fit if you install it in a socket.
- Some old UF-erasable EEPROM chips (very rare) draw to much current and require 10k resistors to be replaced with 3k3-4k7
